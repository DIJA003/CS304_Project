2D fight based Game

contents used: 
  
  Textures are dervative of what we used in labs where i need mutli diff texture for the movements to i had to come up with Map of state and arr of tex...etc
  collision boxes detectors to calculate the hitboxes for the fight, 
  AI controller to enhance singlePlayer exp with 3 level structure(east//passiv - medium//balanced - hard//aggerssive) and pattern recogention
  Animation State for the multiTextures(attack-run-damged-dead-shield parry)
  Player(Knight) has more dynamic strategic appraoch where he must care about his Stamina and Shield up time either in singlePayer or MultiPLayer
  Game stats to keep track of curr state of the game moslty in singlePlayer for now and used in LeaderBoard
  LeaderBoard used to read and write down top scores based on time taken to finish singlePLayer
  used GLU to write down on canvas (names of players under bar - who won the rounds at the end of multiplayer-..etc)

now to singlePlayer:
  player have to win three opponents Skeleton(kinda weak), Knight(the mirror of the player) and the mighty Samurai(spooky)
  each win will give back the stats to the player maybe more? idk ;)
  each win also will give really thrilling backGround sounds so volume up

last Multiplayer:
  each players have to win at least 2 consecutive round to win unfortunately i still haven't added the character choosing :'(
  but music will make u wanna win so bad XD

  Enjoy,
